Episcopal WordPress themes
==========================

Free branded WordPress themes from [The Episcopal Church](http://episcopalchurch.org/), with continuing community development.

Each theme includes three color scheme options availible via WordPress' theme customizer.

## Theme installation

Copy the directory (folder) for the desired theme into `wp-content/themes/` as a subdirectory.

## Plugins not included

Some functionality originally provided in these themes is better suited to plugins which are being developed as the [episcopal_wordpress-plugins][EP] subproject.

Additionally, the initial ZIP archive release included four plugins, which may be downloaded separately:

* [Calendar][P1] v1.3.3 (no longer available at `wordpress.org`)
* [Simple Social Icons][P2] v1.0.6
* [Simple Subscribe][P3] v1.5.6
* [Slideshow][P4] v2.2.21 (also [a GitHub project][G1])

## License

Yet to be determined, but expect something compatible with GNU's GPLv2.
